### Where Should You Start Right Now?


- What is the exact IP of this DNS server in your lab?
- Have you run a quick port scan yet? (What ports are open? Any banners mentioning "ceil", FTP, or unusual ports?)
- Have you tried any DNS queries? What domain name did you guess first?
- Have you tried the credentials "ceil:qwer1234" anywhere obvious?
